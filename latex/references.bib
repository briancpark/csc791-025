abstract = {Today’s landscape of computational science is evolving rapidly, with a need for new, flexible, and responsive supercomputing platforms for addressing the growing areas of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics (DA) and convergent collaborative research. To support this community, we designed and deployed the Bridges-2 platform. Building on our highly successful Bridges supercomputer, which was a high-performance computing resource supporting new communities and complex workflows, Bridges-2 supports traditional and nontraditional research communities and applications; integrates new technologies for converged, scalable high-performance computing (HPC), AI, and data analytics; prioritizes researcher productivity and ease of use; and provides an extensible architecture for interoperation with complementary data intensive projects, campuses, and clouds. In this report, we describe Bridges-2’s hardware and configuration, user environments, and systems support and present the results of the successful Early User Program.},
